# AuthApp

Implementing [this excellent Pragmatic Studio article](https://pragmaticstudio.com/tutorials/rails-session-cookies-for-api-authentication) with Elixir/Phoenix/Absinthe. I intend to include an Elm frontend SPA as well.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
